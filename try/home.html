<h5> About the founder:</h5>
<p>I'm Mariam Atef Hassan, a 20-year-old Computer Engineering student from Alexandria's University in Egypt. I've always been an imaginative person. Whenever I read a novel, I had to set the cast to play the movie adaptaion for this novel first, then I start reading, so that I imaginate the events best. Smiliraly, whenever I watch any movie or show, my mind automatically starts to create a sequel or another story based on what I've watched. I've grown up like that and I know that many of you is like that as well. So I've made this site for all of us to share our imagination and thoughts together. Have fun, imaginators!</p>
